If else Statements:
    If else statements help us write programs that can take divisions based on data.
    they work based on the boolean values.
Syntax:
Simple If statement:
    if(condition){
    // write code here that you want to execute if condition is true
    }

If else statement.
    if(condition){
        // write code here that you want to execute if condition is true
        }else{

        }

Note:
    1)we can press Ctrl+alt+l(windows) or (Cmd+opt+l) to format the code.
    2)we can click on the starting curly bracket and intellij will highlight the ending
    one.
    3)we can double-click anywhere inside a block(anything that a starting { and ending})
