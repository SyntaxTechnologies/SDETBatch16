Arithmetic Operations in java:
    Modulus operator/remainder (%):
    When we use the int data type we can use this operator to get the remainder part. For example
    if we take the remainder of 11 by 5 we will get 1. We can use this operator to find out if
    a number is multiple of another number if a number is even or odd number etc.
String concatenation:
    String concatenation allows us to attach two Strings or one String with any other data type.
    The result will always be a type of String and those two data types will be combined.
