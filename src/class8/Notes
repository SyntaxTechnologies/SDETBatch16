Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a piece of code until a condition becomes false.
    There are 4 main types of loop 1) While loop 2) For loop 3) do while loop 4)
    enhanced for loop
Why should we use loops?
    loops can help us avoid duplicate code.
Syntax for while loop:
    while(condition){
    code that we want to repeat
    }

syntax for for-loop:
    for(initialization of variable;condition;increment/decrement operator){
    code that we want to repeat
    }
syntax for the do-while loop:
    do{

    code that we want to repeat
    }while(condition);
