Arrays:
    Arrays are collection of items. We can store primitive and non-primitive data
    inside arrays.
Why we should learn about arrays?
    1)They help us manage large amounts of data efficiently.
    2) we can process the data stored in arrays using loops
syntax:
    datatype [] name={element 1,element 2,element 3};

Shortcuts:
    1)after the array type iter and intellij will write a enhanced for loop for you
    2) we can place the cursor on the for loop and click on the buld icon to change
    one loop with another one
